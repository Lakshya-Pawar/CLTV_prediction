## Overview
This project focuses on predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) to understand the long-term value of the customers. The goal is to understand customers based on their predicted value to optimize marketing strategies and resource allocation.

## Steps
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzed datasets to understand its structure and features.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created and modified features for better model performance.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Encoded categorical variables, scaled features, and split data into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Building**: Trained regression models (e.g., Linear regression, Random Forest regression).

## Requirements
- Python 3.11-3.12
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Files
- `EDA, CLV prediction.ipynb`: Main jupyter notebook for data analysis, preprocessing, and CLTV prediction.
- `CLTV_predicted.csv`: Dataset containing predicted final CLTV values.
